The following sub-sections briefly describe the toolset required to run the method investigation code and provide instructions for their installation and usage. 

### Tools
A brief discussion of the relevant tools follow.  The tools are widely, and mostly freely, available. 

#### MIT ProbComp

* [ProbComp Github Repository](https://github.com/probcomp/)

The MIT Probabilistic Computing Project has made available [__probcomp__](https://github.com/probcomp) which is a set of libraries written to support the application of artificial intelligence.   To investigate anomaly detection we will use some of the functionality provided by __cgpm__, __crosscat__, and __trcrpm__.  

__cgpm__ is a repository of code to support the implementation of Composable Generative Population Models(CGPM).  CGPM provide a layer of abstraction that supports model composition and provides avenues for both sampling of random variable and generation of conditional densities. 

__crosscat__ provides tools for the Bayesian analysis of high dimensional data tables to support efficient sampling and joint distribution estimation via Bayesian network structure learning and nonparametric mixture modeling.  __crosscat__ can be used to identify predictive relationships between variables, and uncover complex clustering.  

__trcrpm__ is an implementation of Temporally Reweighted Chinese Restaurant Process Mixture Models described in [@saad2018trcrpm].  __trcrpm__ makes calls to __cgpm__ and __crosscat__ to provide a modified version of the Chinese Restaurant Process that introduces a time dependency between successive data-points of the model.   

__cgpm__, __crosscat__, and __trcrpm__ make extensive use of __cython__ and the associated  __gnu c/c++__ backend. 

#### Python and Tools
Useful Links:

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/)
* [cython](https://cython.org/)
* [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

__python 2.7__ is an older version of the very popular __python__ programming language. __cgpm__, __crosscat__, and __trcrpm__ are written in __python 2.7__ which neccesitates its present usage. 

__cython__ is a superset of the __python__ language that provides a static compiler with __c__ extensions and linkage.  __cython__ provides efficient computing for users of __python__.  

__jupyter__ is a web-based development environment that is widely used in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning communities to communicate and collaborate. 

#### docker
Useful Links:

* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)

__docker__ is a popular "platform as a service" container system. __docker__ is used to automate the construction and deployment of specific software bundles and functionality within isolated containers.   Docker is useful for abstracting the installation details and process for specific software integration tasks, allowing the user to focus on system usage rather than installation and maintenance. 

#### Ubuntu 
Useful Links:

* [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)

__ubuntu__ is a popular open source operating system based on the linux kernel. 

#### git
Useful Links:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)

__git__ is a popular distributed version control system. 

### First Time Installation and Setup {#installation}
__crosscat__, __cgpm__, and __trcrpm__ are all implemented in __python 2.7__ and tested on __ubuntu 16.04__.  The following instruction use __docker__ to build an image with the required software bundled.  __docker__ is then used to deploy the image, as a container, from which the investigation code is run.  To successfully complete the following instructions requires root access to a local system running __ubuntu 18.04__ with a working __git__ installation.

To install __docker__, at a console in __ubuntu 18.04__ run the following:
```
# update the apt cache
sudo apt update
# install and update certificate support for docker
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
# update the apt cache to include the newly added/trusted docker repositories
sudo apt update
# install docker
sudo apt install docker-ce
```
To allow your current non-root user to run __docker__, and update user credentials, run the following and enter the root password at the prompt:
```
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
su - ${USER}
```
Next clone the __bnp_time_series__ repository in some desired directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/nick-torenvliet/bnp_time_series.git
```
Enter the docker directory in the cloned __bnp_time_series__ repository:
```
cd bnp_time_series/docker
```
Create a __docker container__ for the application, monitor system resource usage to ensure the process hasn't stalled:
```
docker build --tag bnp_time_series:00.00 .
```
Start the __docker container__ with a shell:
```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -it bnp_time_series:00.00 
```
In the __docker container__ shell change directories to the bnp_time_series directory:
```
cd bnp_time_series
```
Activate the __python__ virtual environment:
```
source /venv/bin/activate
```
Start __jupyter notebook__:
```
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 8888 --ip 0.0.0.0 --allow-root
```
You will get system output that looks something like this:
```
[C 19:59:16.143 NotebookApp] 
    
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-54-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://(d59a4f26bf5d or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=31fa0215191e6636abf09477761404d35484a4614aab4399

```
Copy the URL and paste it into a browser address bar.  Before following the URL, edit it so it is well-formed as the following:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=31fa0215191e6636abf09477761404d35484a4614aab4399
```
You now should have __jupyter notebook__ running in your browser, served from the __docker container__ just created. 

### Post Installation Docker/Jupyter Startup

If you've successfully performed all the steps in the [installation instructions](#installation) and want to come back to the system after shutting down the __docker container__ the following steps need to be performed.

From a __ubuntu__ terminal shell, start the __docker container__ with a shell:
```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -it bnp_time_series:00.00
```
In the __docker__ shell, change directories, activate the __python__ virtual environment, and start __jupyter__:
```
cd bnp_time_series
source /venv/bin/activate
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 8888 --ip 0.0.0.0 --allow-root
```
__jupyter notebook__ is now again accessible from the URL provided in its startup output.
