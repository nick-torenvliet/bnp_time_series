### Jupyer Notebook Example Applications
If the steps in the [installation instructions](#installation) were successfully followed to completion then the example application code will be available through the links in the __jupyter__ directory tree view.  The following sections briefly describe the files.  The __jupyter__ files themselves contain detailed commentary on the usage and coding details, and provide suggestion to use the stub code as a templates to investigate other time series datasets and application.  

#### Jupyter File data_explorer.ipynb
In the files section of the running __jupyter notebook__ instance you will find the __/data__ directory which contains the datasets 
used by the example applications. __data_explorer.ipynb__ give template code to pull, examine, and package data for use by __trcrpm__.

If new data is in __.csv__ format, with an integer index beginning at zero, with all missing data interpolated, __data_explorer.ipynb__ can be used as a template to import and slice new data sets for use in the example application.  Your data must be in a __.csv__ format with variable names in the column headers, all missing data backfilled and interpolated as required, and integer indexing starting at $0$. All the __python__ expression required to accomplish these tasks are in __data_explorer.ipynb__. 

#### Jupyter File data_prediction_one.ipynb
The data used in this example application originates from a temperature sensor monitoring the temperature of a cooling water flow.  The data is indexed over the integers but the original timestamps showed each data point about 2 seconds apart.  Between samples 1500 and 2000 a significant deviation in the signal occurs.  This type of signal excursion is due to corroded contacts at some point in the signal path.
The application demonstrates a significant ability of __trcrpm__ to identify signal abnormalities. 

#### Jupyter File data_prediction_two.ipynb
The data used in this example are taken from four temperature sensors situation on the fore and aft end shields of a CANDU reactor. The data is again indexed on the integers and was read from the field every two seconds.  The application demonstrates the predictive capabilities of the __trcrpm__ in a multivariate setting.

#### Jupyter File data_prediction_three.ipynb
The data used in this example are the same as is __data_prediction_one.ipynb__.  In this application the data is divided into four separate series, with the anomolous behaviour embedded in the third __d3__.  The graphics demonstrate that in the multivariate setting state attribution is heavily influenced by the the goings on in neighbouring series.   

#### Jupyter File anomaly_detection_industrial.ipynb
__anomaly_detection.ipynb__ investigates using the number of states in the inferred model to make conclusions about the incoming data.  
#### Jupyter File multivariate_analysis.ipynb
