### Jupyer Notebook Method Investigations Description of Results
If the steps in the [installation instructions](#installation) were successfully followed to completion then the investigation code will be available through the links in the __jupyter__ directory tree view.  The __jupyter__ files themselves contain detailed commentary on the usage and coding details, and provide suggestion to use the stub code as a templates to investigate other time series datasets and application.  

The following describes the results and general conclusions of the investigation. 

#### Jupyter File investigation_01_univariate_data.ipynb
```{r i1ppf, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Posterior predictive draws for investigation 1"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "i1_posterior_predictive_draws.png"))
```
The first investigation is performed simply to probe the details of __trcrpm__ use.  An industrial data set with a known anomaly was incorported into a a __trcrpm__ and using MCMC inference several inference, and as per the details in the code, several hyper-parameter resampling steps were performed. 

Figure \@ref(fig:i1ppf) shows the results of sampling from the predictive posterior.  We see that without any special treatment in terms of determing hyper-parameters, or pre-processing the data, results provide reasonable percentile confidence bands about the time series data. 

```{r i1s, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Model state attribution"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "i1_model_states.png"))
```

#### Jupyter File investigation_02_multivariate_prediction.ipynb
The data used in this example are taken from four temperature sensors situation on the fore and aft end shields of a CANDU reactor. The data is again indexed on the integers and was read from the field every two seconds.  The application demonstrates the predictive capabilities of the __trcrpm__ in a multivariate setting.

#### Jupyter File investigation_03_multivariate_state_assignment.ipynb
The data used in this example are the same as is __data_prediction_one.ipynb__.  In this application the data is divided into four separate series, with the anomolous behaviour embedded in the third __d3__.  The graphics demonstrate that in the multivariate setting state attribution is heavily influenced by the the goings on in neighbouring series.   

#### Jupyter File investigation_04_univariate_streaming_state_assignment.ipynb
__anomaly_detection.ipynb__ investigates using the number of states in the inferred model to make conclusions about the incoming data.  
#### Jupyter File multivariate_analysis.ipynb
